# ClawMux

Smart model routing + context compression proxy for OpenClaw.

## Features

- 🧠 **Smart Routing**: Embedding-based semantic classification → LIGHT/MEDIUM/HEAVY tier → automatic model selection
- 📦 **Context Compression**: Preemptive background summarization at configurable threshold (default 75%)
- 🔌 **All Providers**: Supports all OpenClaw providers via 6 API format adapters
- ⚡ **Zero Config Auth**: Uses OpenClaw's existing provider credentials — no separate API keys
- 📊 **Cost Tracking**: Real-time savings stats at /stats endpoint
- 🔄 **Hot Reload**: Config changes apply without restart

## Quick Start

Requires [Bun](https://bun.sh) or [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (18+) and a working OpenClaw installation.

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/your-org/ClawMux
cd ClawMux
bash scripts/install.sh
```

The install script:
1. Detects your OpenClaw config at `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` (override with `OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH`)
2. Creates `clawmux.json` from the example if it doesn't exist
3. Registers ClawMux as a provider in your OpenClaw config

Then start the proxy:

```bash
# Bun (recommended — faster startup & runtime)
bun run dev        # watch mode (development)
bun run start      # production

# Node.js
npm run start:node # requires tsx: npm i -D tsx
```

Select a provider in OpenClaw and start chatting:

```bash
openclaw provider clawmux-anthropic
openclaw chat
```

## Configuration

Copy `clawmux.example.json` to `clawmux.json` and adjust as needed:

```jsonc
{
  "compression": {
    "threshold": 0.75,       // trigger compression at 75% of context window
    "model": "anthropic/claude-3-5-haiku-20241022",  // model used for summarization (provider/model format)
    "targetRatio": 0.6       // compress to 60% of original token count
  },
  "routing": {
    "models": {
      "LIGHT": "anthropic/claude-3-5-haiku-20241022",
      "MEDIUM": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
      "HEAVY": "anthropic/claude-opus-4-20250514"
      // Model IDs use 'provider/model' format. Do NOT use provider names starting with "clawmux-" — causes infinite loops
    },
    "scoring": {
      "confidenceThreshold": 0.7  // classification confidence below this → fallback to MEDIUM tier
    }
  },
  "server": {
    "port": 3456,
    "host": "127.0.0.1"
  }
}
```

Config is watched for changes. Edit `clawmux.json` while the proxy is running and it reloads automatically.

### Cross-Provider Routing

Mix models from different providers by tier. ClawMux automatically translates request and response formats between providers:

```jsonc
{
  "routing": {
    "models": {
      "LIGHT": "zai/glm-5",                          // ZAI (openai-completions)
      "MEDIUM": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514",  // Anthropic (anthropic-messages)
      "HEAVY": "openai/gpt-5.4"                       // OpenAI (openai-completions)
    }
  }
}
```

All three providers must be configured in your `openclaw.json`. ClawMux handles format translation transparently — a request arriving in Anthropic format gets translated to OpenAI format when routed to GPT, and the response is translated back to Anthropic format before returning to OpenClaw.

Supported translation pairs: Anthropic ↔ OpenAI ↔ Google ↔ Ollama ↔ Bedrock (all combinations).

## Supported Providers

ClawMux registers itself as six providers in OpenClaw, one per API format:

| API Format | Providers |
|---|---|
| `anthropic-messages` | Anthropic, Synthetic, Kimi Coding |
| `openai-completions` | OpenAI, Moonshot, ZAI, Cerebras, vLLM, SGLang, LM Studio, OpenRouter, Together, NVIDIA, Venice, Groq, Mistral, xAI, HuggingFace, Cloudflare, Volcengine, BytePlus, Vercel, Kilocode, Qianfan, ModelStudio, MiniMax, Xiaomi |
| `openai-responses` | OpenAI (newer), OpenAI Codex |
| `google-generative-ai` | Google Gemini, Google Vertex |
| `ollama` | Ollama |
| `bedrock-converse-stream` | AWS Bedrock |

Use `clawmux-anthropic`, `clawmux-openai`, `clawmux-openai-responses`, `clawmux-google`, `clawmux-ollama`, or `clawmux-bedrock` as the provider name in OpenClaw.

## How It Works

```
OpenClaw → ClawMux Proxy (localhost:3456) → Upstream Provider(s)
              │
              ├── 1. Classify complexity (embedding model, ~4ms first run, <1ms cached)
              ├── 2. Select tier → LIGHT/MEDIUM/HEAVY
              ├── 3. Compress context if threshold exceeded
              ├── 4. Translate request format if cross-provider
              ├── 5. Forward to upstream with correct model
              └── 6. Translate response back to original format
```

**Routing tiers** map to model IDs you configure. A local embedding model (`Xenova/paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2`) classifies the semantic complexity of each request using nearest-centroid classification (~4ms first run, <1ms cached), supporting both Korean and English. Short queries are detected by a lightweight heuristic and routed to LIGHT tier directly. No external API calls are needed for classification.

**Low confidence fallback**: When the classifier's confidence falls below `confidenceThreshold` (default 0.7), the request is routed to MEDIUM tier regardless of the computed score. This prevents unreliable classifications from sending requests to an inappropriate tier — MEDIUM provides a safe cost/quality balance compared to risking unnecessary cost (HEAVY) or degraded quality (LIGHT).

**Context compression** runs in the background after each response. When the conversation approaches the configured threshold, ClawMux summarizes older messages before the next request goes out. This keeps costs down on long conversations without interrupting the flow.

### Context Window Resolution

ClawMux resolves each model's context window using this priority chain:

1. **clawmux.json** `routing.contextWindows` — explicit per-model override
2. **openclaw.json** `models.providers[provider].models[].contextWindow` — user config
3. **OpenClaw built-in catalog** — pi-ai model database (812+ models)
4. **Default: 200,000 tokens**

Compression threshold uses the **minimum** context window across all routing models, since compression happens before routing decides which model to use.

## API Endpoints

## Development

```bash
bun run dev          # start with watch mode
